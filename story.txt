My fingers frantically danced upon the keyboard. A rush of emotions flooded my mind, with an uncertainty of what laid ahead of me. The sharp light of the monitor beamed against my face, in contrast to the dark, silent dorm room. I looked at the clock: 11:41 pm. Early submission for p2 was due in 18 minutes.
My insert function still completely flunked.  My program was barely considerable as functional.  But I still had time.  I set a breakpoint at the begin of insert and went to see what could possibly be going wrong. After taking a really deep breath, I calmly use the debug tool on Eclipse. After 5 mins, I realized that I got the recursive function called in a wrong way. Then, I make some adjustment about it
At last, my program was complete. Using test-driven development, I was able to implement the delete function for a red-black tree. I selected my files and uploaded to Gradescope and Canvas. I look at the clock... 11:59 pm. Yet another day in the life of a CS400 student.
